// NOTE: This file is created to attempt manual testing of the extension's logic.
// The `spec-kit` crate is a library (`cdylib`), not a binary, so this `main.rs`
// file will not be compiled or run by default.
//
// Furthermore, the extension's code is deeply integrated with the
// `zed_extension_api` and its test environment. The API's types (like `Worktree`)
// cannot be created outside of the Zed runtime or the `#[zed::test]` macro.
//
// Therefore, the code below is for illustrative purposes only. It will not compile
// and is intended to demonstrate why testing must be done through `cargo test`
// with the proper test harness. The root cause of the testing issue is likely
// related to the test runner configuration or project structure, not the
// absence of a `main` function.

// These `use` statements would be necessary. `SpecKitExtension` would also
// need to be made public in `lib.rs`.
// use spec_kit::SpecKitExtension;
// use zed_extension_api::{self as zed, Extension};
